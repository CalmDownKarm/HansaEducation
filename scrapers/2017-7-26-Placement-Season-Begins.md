title: Placement Season Begins
---
So placement season is upon us. It's quickly making me realize that I'm terrabad at producing code quickly. For example, I just sat for the first online round for Directi today. In 90 minutes, we had to solve 3 questions; it took me about 30 minutes to figure out how to solve two of them, and the better part of an hour to write out code for a single solution. I'm just too slow as of now. 

I'm obviously not fluent enough in Python and C++ to be able to write both effortlessly. it's actually quite funny - doing poorly in an interview with a python house led me to spend 6 months writing exclusively python and slowly falling in love with how convenient writing code in python is. However, most companies in India want C/C++ for interview rounds - and I've developed really bad habits (for a C++ programmer) due to writing python for the last six months. I guess a challenge for me now would be to improve my fluency in C++ without sacrificing python. 

The problems themselves weren't too challenging, infact they were downright straightforward, which makes my inability to solve them quickly even more disappointing. 
The first problem was to implement a LRU Cache, second was to implement Djikstra's algo and in the third we had to parse a string and create a tree according to their format.
