The bioengineering master's program has two components: an interdisciplinary core curriculum, including one class outside of students' chosen sub-specialty to increase the breadth of bioengineering knowledge; and courses required by the department for students' chosen track.
The Biomechanical Systems and Devices track investigates the application of technology to human biological systems. Areas of study include the mechanics of hard and soft tissues, human biomechanics, dynamics of human-machine interaction, and the design of assistive technology and medical devices. Students develop a foundation with core courses in thermal-fluid processes, mechanics and materials, or dynamic/robotic systems, and specialize in a particular area of study through the appropriate selection of elective courses.", 135,"$27,472.00 (17,69,169)
